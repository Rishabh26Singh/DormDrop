DormDrop operates on a straightforward principle: when a hostel resident requires a product from Lanka or anywhere off-campus, they can request it through the app. On the other hand, if someone is traveling from Lanka or an area outside the campus, they can accept the order, deliver it, and earn a delivery charge. DormDrop was conceived with the firm belief that the future of logistics hinges on providing exceptional user experiences. Since its inception, DormDrop has expanded, yet its fundamental mission remains unchanged: to enhance the global trade of large freight through a seamless and user-friendly service."
